## 📌 Features

- 🚀 Report civic issues with title, description, image, ward, category, and map location.
- 🧠 ML-based category suggestion using SpaCy + Logistic Regression.
- 🧭 Intelligent duplicate detection using OpenAI embeddings + Cosine Similarity.
- 🧑‍💼 Admin dashboard for verifying issues and updating statuses.
- 📊 Real-time statistics and issue analytics.
- 🧾 Role-based access: Guests, Users, Ward Admins.
- 🗺️ Map view for verified issues (Leaflet.js).

## 🧠 Algorithms & Intelligence

### 1. 🔁 Cosine Similarity + Blocking for Duplicate Detection
- Uses OpenAI’s `text-embedding-3-large` model for semantic similarity.
- Blocks comparison scope by **ward + category** for performance.
- Prompts user if similarity ≥ 70% to reduce redundancy.

### 2. 🏷️ Multi-Label Classification (Category Prediction)
- Titles vectorized using **SpaCy’s `en_core_web_lg` model**.
- Logistic Regression classifier predicts category onBlur.
- Enhances admin efficiency and user experience.
